# Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem using different programming languages. The genetic algorithm makes use of the following features:

* Roulette wheel selection
* Single point crossover
* Bit flip mutation

The Genetic Algorithm is currently implemented in the following languages:

* C++
* Go
* Java
* Julia
* Matlab/Octave
* Python
* Rust
